              <h2>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h2>
              <p>Once I was told by a co-worker that I was hard to get to know. She was tasked to be the liaison for her department if they needed change to the online application system or if something wasn’t working right. Whenever she wanted to bring up, most of the time she would say  “Sorry if this is a stupid question as this might be trivial to you… “ or “Hope this request won’t give you more work…” She said she did that out of fear I would think negatively…  well.. I did think that some of their ideas were insane.</p>
              <p> We clearly started off not on the same boat and without trust. So one day, I decided that rather than having meeting at my desk, we went to the coffee shop since lunch time followed after that. When we finished early, we would continue talking about our work. It didn’t take long for me to know what it involved for Admission department to get a student enrolled. I also empathize whenever she feels frustrated about work. All that information, gave me the motivation on how can I make the system that I build better. It made sense that we share the same goal -  if we don’t get students enrolled, both of us will be out of work. On her side, she got to know why some change require couple of days even though it might be small from the user side or why this isn’t such a good idea.</p>

              <h2>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h2>
              <p>I did the exercise with my partner. It was okay since we are already used to with the previous listen and loop technique. This time I'm required to gauge her feeling by saying “What I hear you feel….” It was slight different for me because whenever I sense she was down, I had the urge to go put on the kettle because I know she would like to have a tea because it makes things better. I know better not to get up and disrupt the session.</p>

              <h2>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
              <p>Never tried this but I think it should be easy to wish happiness to friends and family - those who you love. Currently I don’t have anyone I hate or annoy me… Ok. I’ll try on javascript problem next time :)</p>

              <h2>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h2>
              <p>There was one situation when I was called out at my previous job for being incompetent in an email thread. My department launched a new portal at the beginning of the school year and one department head came at me saying that I’ve changed the content completely and that he wasn’t consulted. I mentioned to him I only transferred what was from the old portal unless there was already agreement made before. </p>

              <p><b>My view</b><br />
              He was making accusatory without any basis or evidence. From the logs, I have not made any changes to the page for ages. </p>

              <p><b>His views</b><br />
              Sam was the only one who could have done it since she developed the portal and is the administrator. Who else could change it? </p>

              <p>At the end, tracked an email from couple of years ago from an old IT Administrator who decided to update the page without committing a log message about his change and then not communicating to the head of the department after that - so both of us were not in the loop.</p>

              <p>Though I have to say that yes both were not at fault but his language in the email was not appropriate and my frustration was that the Administrator who was copied in it didn’t intervene.</p>

              <h2>Any other musings?</h2>
              None.
