If you want to go far, go together.</em></p> <p>I feel like that is me sometime. Whenever I get excited, I will dive into it the rabbit hole and do not want anyone to bother. However, I tend to loose the passion quickly because I will ll get stuck at certain point and do not have anyone I can ask for help or I did it because you want to get the badges - who does not like badges???. Also, there is only you can get from interaction through message board. One big reason to do this bootcamp is to have that experience in working with a group of people who share common goal.</p> <h3>It is okay to break things</h3><p>Something that I really need to keep in mind. Even if you break something, hopefully you already learned to follow development best practices and not have to start from scratch.</p> <h2>Q: How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2><p>With great enthusiasm and open mind. Though people say that I’m an introvert so this is a good practice for me to be more open.</p><h2>Q: Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2> <p>Definitely excited!! So far people I talked to on Slack have been pretty welcoming! :)</p>',

In practice, we will use the following approach:</p> <h3>Fluid grids and Flexible Images</h3> <p>When we deal with layout or image, we have to remember that we will not use fix measurement like px (pixel) but will use % (percentage) or em (Ems) for width or height instead.</p> <h3>Media Queries</h3> <p>Another approach is to use media queries to target the device’s width and apply the appropriate style. It can also load a different style sheet based on type of media. For instance, when a user want to print the website, we give them a printer-friendly version rather than the default style sheet.</p> <h2>What mobile first design is, and why it is important.</h2> <p>It is different approach to design a website. Usually we would design website by focusing on desktop and then trickle down to the smaller devices.  Mobile first design is the other way around. </p><h2>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h2><p>Framework is meant to help you code faster and save time by allowing you to re-use code onto your project - you don’t have to start from scratch. Usually frameworks, the good ones are a collaboration by many developers or backed by a company so you can be sure they are tested and will work - no need too worry much about browser compatibility.</p> <p> However, since you are using someone else’s code, you will have to follow their standard. This can be small and easy to learn or it change your entire work process. </p><h2>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h2> <p>Wireframe is a blueprint of your website.

HTML is a markup language which gives website's content some structure. CSS is the style sheet language which improves the website’s presentation. Javascript provides interactivity for the end user. What I found Javascript different from the other two is that it can store values, create objects, setup re-usable code (function) and handle logic … I’m sure I’m just scratching the surface here.</p><p>A very important part that I have to be aware when using Javascript is that it is case sensitive. E.g: myArray is not equal to MyArray.</p><h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h2><p><strong>Control Flow  - Checking to see if condition meets the criteria and if criteria met, will direct your result.</strong><br />Before you can get a loan from a bank, you will need to convince the bank that you are a trustworthy person who is able to pay the loan back.  At the bank, different departments will check your application and check off if individual criteria is met. E.g: Are you old enough to get a loan? If not, do you have a co-signature as a guarantor... the list goes on.</p><p><strong>Loops - Doing same thing until it meets goal.</strong><br />A swimmer who is doing freestyle for 1000 meter in a 50 meter pool. The swimmer will do the same movement where after three strokes he will come up for breath. At every 50 meter, he will flip and swim the other direction until he reaches 1000 meter.</p><h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2><h3>Accessing data from arrays</h3><p>To access array’s data, you will need to use a number position surrounded by a  square bracket around it. This method is called <strong>Square Bracket Notation</strong>. The first data will start at number 0. </p><pre><code>var mySuperHero = ['Spiderman' , 'Thor' , 'Captain America'];</code></pre><p>In order to call Captain America, we will use mySuperHero[<strong>2</strong>] since he is in position 2.</p><h3>Accessing data from Object</h3><p>There are two ways to do this. First one is the above method - Square Bracket Notation. However, rather than specifying a number, you will use the data label.</p><pre><code>var person = {\"First Name\": \"Sam\", \"Last Name\": \"Manongga\"};/* To call the value Sam */person[\"FirstName\"]; // Sam</code></pre><p>Second method is where you use the name of the data label you want to access. The method is known as <strong>Dot Notation</strong>.</p><pre><code>var person = {firstName: \u201CSam\u201D, lastName: \u201CManongga\u201D}; /* To call the value Sam */ person.firstName </pre></code><h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2><p>Functions in Javascript allow you to group a set of code together and to re-use the grouped code in different parts of your program. This will make your code  more manageable and structured. Example: In case there is an error, you can do faster debugging by pinpointing the faulty function instead of reading line by line.</p>",

          body: "<h2>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h2><p>This week I have to catch up on Week 5 and 6 assignments so I was already stressing myself out. One particular assignment triggered my frustration because it didn’t say that we had to do it even though if we didn’t do it, the program won’t work correctly. At the end, I decided to go with it so that the program work as it should.</p><p> I also get frustrated when explanation isn't clear enough... or that they are being so vague you don't know what they are expecting from you.  I noticed it when I was working on freecodecamp assigments, some topics weren't as clearly explained compare to codacademy.com and I was like...why couldn't they explain like that?</p><h2>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h2><p>It makes sense. Before SBNRR, I was so drained emotionally because I refused to give up on the problem but was about to scream at the monitor out of frustration. I think using this technique will help clear out my thoughts from any negativity that I have about the problem. Breathing also helps calming my nerve before giving the problem another try. I have been doing that part of the meditation and it make sense that it applies here as well as it clear have positive affect on your body and mind. While the notice part will help me understand why I feel this way. Maybe understand that it is time to find another way to solve the problem or by asking help from someone - Acknowledge your shortcoming without judgement then you will respond appropriately.</p>",

          body: "<h2>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h2><p>Once I was told by a co-worker that I was hard to get to know. She was tasked to be the liaison for her department if they needed change to the online application system or if something wasn’t working right. Whenever she wanted to bring up, most of the time she would say  'Sorry if this is a stupid question as this might be trivial to you… ' or 'Hope this request won’t give you more work…' She said she did that out of fear I would think negatively…  well.. I did think that some of their ideas were insane.</p><p> We clearly started off not on the same boat and without trust. So one day, I decided that rather than having meeting at my desk, we went to the coffee shop since lunch time followed after that. When we finished early, we would continue talking about our work. It didn’t take long for me to know what it involved for Admission department to get a student enrolled. I also empathize whenever she feels frustrated about work. All that information, gave me the motivation on how can I make the system that I build better. It made sense that we share the same goal - if we don’t get students enrolled, both of us will be out of work. On her side, she got to know why some change require couple of days even though it might be small from the user side or why this isn’t such a good idea.</p><h2>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h2><p>I did the exercise with my partner. It was okay since we are already used to with the previous listen and loop technique. This time I'm required to gauge her feeling by saying 'What I hear you feel….' It was slight different for me because whenever I sense she was down, I had the urge to go put on the kettle because I know she would like to have a tea because it makes things better. I know better not to get up and disrupt the session.</p><h2>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2><p>Never tried this but I think it should be easy to wish happiness to friends and family - those who you love. Currently I don’t have anyone I hate or annoy me… Ok. I’ll try on javascript problem next time :)</p><h2>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h2><p>There was one situation when I was called out at my previous job for being incompetent in an email thread. My department launched a new portal at the beginning of the school year and one department head came at me saying that I’ve changed the content completely and that he wasn’t consulted. I mentioned to him I only transferred what was from the old portal unless there was already agreement made before. </p><p><b>My view</b><br />He was making accusatory without any basis or evidence. From the logs, I have not made any changes to the page for ages. </p><p><b>His views</b><br />Sam was the only one who could have done it since she developed the portal and is the administrator. Who else could change it? </p><p>At the end, tracked an email from couple of years ago from an old IT Administrator who decided to update the page without committing a log message about his change and then not communicating to the head of the department after that - so both of us were not in the loop.</p><p>Though I have to say that yes both were not at fault but his language in the email was not appropriate and my frustration was that the Administrator who was copied in it didn’t intervene.</p><h2>Any other musings?</h2>None.",

          body: "<h2>Explain to a non tech friend what Scope is </h2> <p>In a non-programming context, a scope is similar to how laws or regulations work in a country. The central government defines a rule that you have to be 21 years old to vote. This rule applies to every level of local government - states > city > town > borough > neighborhood. This is what we call a Global Scope. When a lower level government defines a rule, it is called Local Scope because local government can not dictate nationally and same rule can have different meaning to other states. Example: State of New York, when it comes to getting your learner permit, you have to be 16 years old. However, the state of California, the legal age is 15 1/2. </p><h2>How does it work in JavaScript</h2><p>In Javascript term, we are talking about the visibility and accessibility of your variables/ functions/ objects inside the program. Knowing their scope helps to prevent bugs and unexpected behavior.</p><h3>Global Scope</h3><p>Anything that is not declared inside a function will automatically have global scope. It exists as long as the program runs and is accessible within function. <b>Variable</b>\r\n <pre><code>\r\n var name = 'Sam';\r\n\r\n function helloName() {\r\n return name;\r\n }\r\n\r\n helloName(); // Sam\r\n </code></pre>\r\n <b>Function</b>\r\n <pre><code>\r\n function helloName() {\r\n console.log('Sam');\r\n }\r\n\r\n function executeHelloName() {\r\n helloName();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n executeHelloName(); // Sam\r\n </code></pre>\r\n <h3>Local Scope</h3>\r\n <p>Anything that lives inside a function will only exist as long the function is called and will be deleted after the function is finished.

How did it go?</h2><p>I’m hoping after bootcamp, I’ll be able to find a job in web development again because I love my old job and had fun working with people who are passionate about what they do and consider their job a hobby. I feel those people who are chill, less stress and eager to learn. When one of us had an AHAH moment, we took pleasure in sharing with one another. Once, I explained to the photographer why systems prefer CSV file type as import and that it would be advantageous to know Excel - Coincidentally, he was testing out software that will help him batch rename his photos and what do you know, it uses CSV file type to match name to the files. Yeah so it was constantly about learning, sharing and having fun… getting paid was the by product. :)</p><h2>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values?
